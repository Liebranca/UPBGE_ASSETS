# AUVI

Forever free assets and asset-making tools for game developers using Blender on Linux.

This project began as an UPBGE affaire exclusive to Blender 2.79; I am now slowly porting it to versions 2.8+ and making fixes and redesigns along the way.

Due to this transition, the repo will remain over halfway in a state of complete disarray until all the small pieces are put in it's place.
